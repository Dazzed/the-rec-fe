        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>

        <p>Effective Date: April ___, 2021</p>

        <p>
          Thank you for using Get Tag (“Get Tag,” “we,” or “us”). These Terms of
          Service ("Terms") govern your use of our extension and website,
          <a href="https://www.get-tag.com/"> https://get-tag.com</a>, along
          with any other website or mobile application(s) that we may operate
          (collectively and together with any subdomains and the content and
          services therein, the Get Tag “Site”). Get Tag allows you to bookmark
          and review goods that you find online, and to see what your friends
          and other online users have bookmarked and reviewed (each a
          “Service”). The Site and any Service are collectively referred to
          herein as the “Services.” These Terms incorporate the Get Tag
          <a href="https://www.get-tag.com/privacy-policy"> Privacy Policy </a>
          along with any other end user license agreement(s), terms and
          conditions, and policies that may apply to our Services, features,
          promotions, other functionality, and/or customer service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please read these Terms carefully before accessing or otherwise using
          our Services. The Terms represent a binding contract between you and
          Get Tag, and by creating an account, accessing our Site, or otherwise
          using Get Tag, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and
          expressly agree to be bound by them. If you do not agree to all of
          these Terms, you should not use the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          PLEASE NOTE THAT IF THERE IS A DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND US, THAT
          DISPUTE IS SUBJECT TO MANDATORY ARBITRATION RATHER THAN COURT
          PROCEEDINGS. THESE TERMS REQUIRE ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS,
          WHICH MEANS THAT YOU MAY NOT SEEK RELIEF IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT.
          THESE TERMS SET FORTH SPECIFIC REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO YOU. PLEASE SEE
          THE ARBITRATION SECTION BELOW TO LEARN MORE.
        </p>

        <h4>Use of the Services and Account Registration</h4>
        <p>
          The Services allow you to bookmark and review certain goods and
          products (collectively, “Goods”) which are offered online by
          independent merchants, and to see those Goods which your friends and
          other Get Tag users have bookmarked and reviewed for further
          consideration, all in order to help you make more informed purchase
          decisions. All Goods are offered by independent merchants, not Get Tag
          directly. Accordingly, while Get Tag may provide product information
          and detail, including pricing information, we are not a reseller or
          distributor of any of the Goods available on or through Get Tag, and
          we do not warrant the descriptions, reviews or any other information
          pertaining to any Goods to be accurate, complete, reliable, current or
          error-free. If you elect to purchase any of the Goods bookmarked or
          reviewed on Get Tag, your purchase is a direct engagement with the
          specific merchant and will be made via the merchant’s online
          storefront.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to use certain features of the Services you are required to
          establish a Get Tag account (“Account”). To establish an Account, you
          need only to log in with your personal Facebook account. Get Tag will
          import information and detail from your Facebook account to help
          better offer the Services to you. You represent that the Facebook
          account linked to your Get Tag Account belongs to you and that you are
          permitted to link the same Facebook account with Get Tag in the manner
          contemplated herein. You are responsible for maintaining the
          confidentiality and security of your Account, including your log-in
          credentials. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities
          that occur via your Account, and to notify us as promptly as possible
          if you believe there has been any unauthorized use of your Account or
          linked Facebook information. Notwithstanding, Get Tag will not be
          liable for any losses or damages suffered by any party because of any
          unauthorized access to or use of your Account.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that we may send communications to your Account, including
          your Facebook profile and/or associated email address(es), for
          customer service, confirmations, newsletters, product offers and other
          matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Services are not intended to be used by children without
          involvement and approval of a parent or guardian. If you are under the
          age of 13, you are not permitted to register with us or provide your
          personal information to us. If you are at least 13 and under 18 years
          of age (or under the applicable age of majority in your state or
          territory of residence), you may register with Get Tag, but only if
          you have the consent of your parent or guardian, including agreement
          to these Terms on your behalf, and for clarity, you may only modify an
          Account with the consent of your parent or guardian.
        </p>

        <h4>Changes to These Terms</h4>
        <p>
          We are always looking for ways to improve the Services. We may need to
          alter or discontinue the Services, or certain parts of the same, to
          make performance or security improvements, change functionality and
          features, make changes to comply with law, or prevent illegal
          activities on or abuse of our systems. These changes may affect all
          users, some users or even an individual user. Whenever reasonably
          possible, we will provide notice when we discontinue or make material
          changes to the Services that will have an adverse impact on the use of
          the Services. However, you understand and agree that there will be
          times when we make such changes without notice, such as where we feel
          we need to take action to improve the security and operability of the
          Services, prevent abuse, or comply with legal requirements.
        </p>

        <h4>Get Tag Is Not Responsible for Third-Parties</h4>

          Goods is subject to the third-party merchant’s own terms and

          agree that Get Tag is not responsible or liable to you for any content
          or other materials hosted and served from any website or destination
          other than Get Tag.

          is under no obligation to be involved in such dispute, and you release

        <h4>ARBITRATION OF CLAIMS</h4>
        <p>
          PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS IN IMPORTANT WAYS.
          If you have dispute with us, you agree to first discuss any issue
          informally with us for at least 60 days before commencing an
          arbitration proceeding. To do that, please send your full name and
          contact information, your concern and your proposed solution by mail
          to us at: Get Tag LLC, 7 Carriglea Drive, Riverside, CT 06878 Attn:
          Legal Department. If we would like to discuss an issue with you, we
          will contact you using the email address you provided when you
          registered for Get Tag.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we do not reach an agreed upon solution after our discussions for
          at least 60 days, you and Get Tag agree that any and all claims,
          except disputes relating to the ownership or enforcement of
          intellectual property rights, that either of us may have, whether
          based on past, present, or future events, arising out of or relating
          to: (i) these Terms (including formation, performance, or breach of
          them, and including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration
          provision); (ii) the Privacy Policy, which is incorporated in these
          Terms; (iii) any aspect of our relationship with each other; and (iv)
          use of the Services, must be resolved through binding arbitration.
          Arbitration will be administered by JAMS Mediation, Arbitration, and
          ADR Services (“JAMS”) in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined
          Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The JAMS Rules and
          instructions about how to initiate an arbitration are available at
          <a href="www.jamsadr.com"> www.jamsadr.com</a> or 1-800-352-5267.
          Please note that YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN
          COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. As an exception to this arbitration
          agreement, Get Tag is happy to give you the right to pursue in small
          claims court any claim that is within that court's jurisdiction,
          whether or not you discussed with us informally first, as long as you
          proceed only on an individual basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          YOU AND GET TAG AGREE TO ARBITRATE IN EACH OF OUR INDIVIDUAL
          CAPACITIES ONLY, NOT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS, AND
          EACH OF US EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK
          RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS. No arbitration or proceeding can be combined
          with another without the prior written consent of you, Get Tag, and
          any other parties to the arbitration or proceedings.
        </p>
        <p>
          For your convenience, arbitration may be conducted in-person, through
          the submission of documents, by phone, or online. Proceedings that
          cannot be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or
          online, will take place in Chicago, Illinois. Rather than force
          everyone to visit us in Illinois, if you can demonstrate that
          arbitration in Illinois would create an undue burden to you, you are
          free to initiate the arbitration in your home state. It is important
          that you understand that the arbitrator's decision will be binding and
          final (except for a limited right of appeal under the U.S. Federal
          Arbitration Act) and may be entered as a judgment in any court of
          competent jurisdiction. Please note that nothing in this section shall
          be construed as consent by Get Tag to the jurisdiction of any other
          court with regard to disputes not covered by these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          In accordance with the JAMS Rules, the party initiating the
          arbitration (either you or Get Tag) is responsible for paying the
          filing fee. However, if the arbitrator issues you an award of damages
          and: (i) that award is greater than the amount of our last written
          settlement offer; or (ii) if we did not make a settlement offer, then
          in addition to paying for any JAMS Case Management Fees and all
          professional fees for the arbitrator’s services, we will reimburse you
          for the filing fees you incurred.
        </p>

        <h4>Limitation of Time to Bring a Claim </h4>
        <p>
          To help resolve any issues between us promptly, you and Get Tag agree
          to bring any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms
          (including Get Tag’s Privacy Policy), our relationship, or the use of
          the Services within one year after a claim arises; otherwise, the
          claim is waived. This limitation applies regardless of the venue in
          which such claim is or could otherwise be asserted.
        </p>

        <h4>General Provisions</h4>
        <p>
          <u>Choice of Law and Forum.</u> These Terms are governed by, and
          construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware
          without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. To the extent
          that the arbitration provision outlined herein above is not applicable
          (e.g., when confirming an arbitration award), you and Get Tag agree to
          submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in
          Wilmington, Delaware.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>No Waiver.</u> Get Tag's decision to delay exercising or enforcing
          any right or remedy under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of
          such right or remedy with respect to any party. Even if Get Tag acts
          in a way that appears to you to be inconsistent with these Terms, Get
          Tag's action shall not be deemed a waiver or constructive amendment of
          these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>
            Integration, Amendment, Severability, and Electronic Communications.
          </u>{' '}
          Please note that these Terms, including Get Tag's Privacy Policy and
          any end user license agreement that might accompany the applicable
          Services, constitute the entire legal agreement between you and Get
          Tag and govern your use of the Services, and completely replaces any
          prior agreements between you and Get Tag in relation to the Services.
          In the unlikely event that a customer service representative or
          material posted on the Get Tag Site provides information that is
          inconsistent with these Terms, please be aware that these Terms will
          control. These Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law.
          If any provision of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or
          unenforceable, you and we agree that the provision will be deemed
          severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and
          enforceability of any remaining provisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Survival.</u> The provisions of these Terms which by their nature
          should survive cancellation or deletion of your account shall survive
          such cancellation or deletion.
