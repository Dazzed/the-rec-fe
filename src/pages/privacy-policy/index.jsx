        <p>
          Get Tag does not knowingly target children and makes reasonable
          efforts to ensure that the targeting of children does not occur.
          Children 16 and under are not eligible to use Get Tag's Services
          without the participation and supervision of a legal parent or
          guardian. If you believe your child has provided Get Tag with personal
          information, please contact us at{' '}
          <a href="mailto:info@get-tag.com">info@get-tag.com</a> so we can
          remove the information.

        <h4 className="text-bold">DATA STORAGE AND RETENTION</h4>
        <p>
          We store your information for as long as necessary to provide our
          Services and to fulfill our legal and contractual obligations. We will
          set a Get Tag registry to “private,” which hides the registry from
          search engines, if a user does not log in to their registry for 12
          months, or the registry has no other activity for 90 days, whichever
          is sooner.
